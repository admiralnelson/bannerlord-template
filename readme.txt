copy BattleTest to Modules directory, and put the DLL in the bin folder. 
To run, ManagedStarter.exe must be run with this commandline argument (in VS debug or command prompt)  _MODULES_*Native*BattleTest*_MODULES_ 

Don't forget to put proper working directory (it's located at where the ManagedStarter.exe resides)

Enjoy.
You can use this as your template project.
